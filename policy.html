        <h3 class="about-title">Our Proposals</h3>
        <p class="proposal-body">   In order to develop policies to combat food deserts, we must first identify 
            why the food deserts exist in certain areas of Houston or the policies that we suggest to implement 
            might not accurately address the problem. We identified four key factors that contributed to the 
            creation of food deserts in tracts of Houston - lack of grocery stores, lack of healthy foods, lack 
            of transportation, and high prices on healthy foods. </p>
        <h1 class="proposal-header">1. Incentivize Grocery Store Openings </h1>
        <p class="proposal-body">   Certain areas of Houston have a serious lack of grocery stores. Some residents 
            travel miles just to get food. Many times this is due to big supermarkets being unwilling to open 
            up stores in low-income areas for fear of losing profit. To fight against this problem, we propose 
            that the city of Houston offer grants or loans to incentivize businesses to open stores in food deserts 
            in order to provide for those living there. </p>
            <h1 class="proposal-header">2. Increase Healthy Foods</h1>
            <p class="proposal-body">   Because a food desert also means an area that has limited access to nutritious 
                food, the lack of healthy foods also contributes to the overall problem. Even if residents have nearby
                 food options, many times the choices are only convenience stores and fast food chains, neither of which 
                 contain healthy options for neighborhoods there. As a result of this, we believe Houston should be 
                 taking the initiative to stock healthy alternatives in the stores that already exist within a nearby 
                 radius of the residents. </p>
            <h1 class="proposal-header">3. Lowering Prices</h1>
            <p class="proposal-body">   At times, even when residents have access to grocery stores with healthy options, 
                the prices are too high for them to afford. When this is the problem, many residents choose to just buy 
                food from the cheapest and most convenient option, which most of the time are unhealthy options.  To 
                combat this, the government of Houston can increase the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, 
                also known as food stamps) benefits in order to support the nutritional intake of residents. An example 
                of SNAP benefits would be the usage of Electronic Benefit Transfer Cards at farmersâ€™ markets, encouraging 
                residents to buy fresh produce as the government allows them money bonuses as they shop there. </p>
            <h1 class="proposal-header">4. Increasing Access to Transportation </h1>
            <p class="proposal-body">   Even when residents have access to healthy foods and grocery stores and are financially 
                able to buy the food they need, transportation can still be a barrier to healthy food access. There are a 
                variety of ways Houston can solve this problem - allowing purchase of food online with SNAP benefits, 
                improving public transportation and utilize fresh produce vans. </p>
            <h1 class="proposal-header">5. Increase Nutrition and Accessibility of Schools Lunches</h1>
            <p class="proposal-body">School lunches are critical to student health and well-being. Increasing the nutrition 
                value in school lunches promotes healthy eating habits at a young age and improves learning. Research also 
                shows that access to school lunches reduces food insecurity and obesity rates.</p>
