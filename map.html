                <p class="map-desc">FOOD DESERTS are areas with limited access to affordable and nutritious food. There is an emphasis
                    on "affordable" food as a metric, as locations with food priced at prohibitively high dollar values can 
                    easily be overlooked. <br/> <br/>Out of Houston's population of 2.33 million people, nearly a fourth live in USDA 
                    designated food desert areas. These in turn have debilitating effects on both individual and community health,
                    which lead to a high rise in avoidable health care costs. <br/> <br/>In analyzing the data sets that we extracted from
                    the <a class="kinder" target="_blank" href="https://www.kinderudp.org/#/datasetCatalog/5n0oa0q8x6xy">Kinder Institute</a>, the final metric we had for scoring the relative intensity of each food desert was through a Food
                     Access Measure, which is found after incorporating both the population characteristic and store characteristic of a 
                     location. Key components include neighborhood-level measures of the distance to a store, the number of stores, availability
                    of shelf space devoted to specific food items and square-footage of grocery retail. </p>
                <h3 class="little-header">What Houston is Doing Right Now </h3>
                <p class="map-desc">In 2011, as the White House started their efforts to combat food deserts nationally, Houston’s government 
                    also began to establish policies to improve the lack of food access in Houston and community leaders in Houston took action 
                    to fix their communities’ food insecurities. The government first established the Houston grocery access task which is made 
                    up of leaders from a variety of different sectors - economic, public health, civic. They meet up to discuss barriers to 
                    grocery store development and work to encourage more grocery investment in Houston. One of their first projects was the 
                    establishment Pyburn Grocery to serve South Union and its surrounding neighborhoods. The owner of Pyburn received $1.7 
                    million for predevelopment, land acquisition, construction and equipment from the city, serving as a more accessible source 
                    of healthy food as originally more than half of the residents in south Houston lived more than a mile away from their nearest 
                    grocery store.<br/><br/>Additionally, Houston has also implemented Double Up, a Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program 
                    (SNAP), in 2019. This program specifically aims to help SNAP recipients, allowing them to buy from farmers’ markets to get fresh 
                    goods. Double Up also enables them to bring home $40 worth of fresh produce for only $20. <br/><br/>Specific community and county 
                    solutions are seen in Third Ward and the 2020 implementation of Healthy Food Financing Initiative for Harris County. Third Ward has 
                    taken community action, building a community garden full of fresh and nutritious food options. The Nu Waters Co-op, run by Third Ward 
                    residents, has taken produce from community gardens, bringing healthy options to the neighborhood. Lastly, the 2020 implementation of 
                    Healthy Food Financing Initiative for Harris County, approved of $400 million in grants and loans to assist retailers to locate neighborhoods 
                    with a lack of access to fresh foods.</p>
